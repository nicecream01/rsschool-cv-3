### About me
I started to study Front-end development in 2021. And I really liked it. I am currently taking the Stage #0 course in **RS School**. 


I am very responsible, I work well in a team. I want to develop new skills even further, including soft skills and hard skills, and become a good programmer.

### Skills:
* HTML
* CSS / SASS / Bootstrap
* Git /GitHub
* JavaScript Basics
* VS Code
* Figma
* Adobe Photoshop

### Code Example:
``` 
function zeroArray(m, n) {
  let newArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    let row = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      row.push(0);
    }
    newArray.push(row);
  }
  return newArray;
}
let matrix = zeroArray(3, 2);
console.log(matrix);
```
